The start of a hopefully profitable journey
My Name is Gerardo. Due to Covid economic crisis in my country I find myself in the need of searching new job oportunities and, in that search of something challenging and profitable to do, I find coding to be an excellent challenge. For what I can see, it's not only demanding on an intellectual level, but also needs a very creative mind and a hunger for knowledge, all things that thrills me. So now i'm in this journey, enjoying myself and learning a lot of new cool stuff.
